![halfCageSeagull4A001](https://github.com/Archive-663/seagull_4a_TLR/blob/main/ASSETS/PHOTO/PRODUCT/1.jpg)


### Features:
- Uses factory waist level finder screws
- Allows you to adapt any viewfinder that will fit onto the Seagull 4A body

### What you'll need:
- 4x M1.6 x 5mm self tapping or machine screws
- 4x Original viewfinder mounting screws
- Assortment of mini files

### What would be helpful:
- M1.6 Drill bit
- M1.6 Tap
- M1.4 Drill bit for pilot tap hole

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
-PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 threads require M1.4 bore.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, download FreeCAD to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.

### Bring your own viewfinder:
Download the STEP files and modify the adapter to fit your viewfinder in the CAD package of your choice.
