### Background Story:
This camera was my first foray into Medium Format. It's a wonderfully cheap, but effective 6x6 camera. While I'm okay using it as it, I felt there were a few things that could be improved. So I added a half cage with standard 1/4-20 mounts, Arca Swiss plate, and common film reminder dials. I could not find camera strap lugs so I used my GFX camera strap lugs with 3d printed locks to allow me to use it on the Seagull. I've since found out that the Canon EOS M (original) camera strap lugs work on the Seagull with little to no modification.
