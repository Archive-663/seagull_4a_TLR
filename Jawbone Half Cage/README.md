### Features:
- Arca-Swiss compatible rail.
- Customizable & Removeable 90 degree Arca-Swiss rail.
- Common dilm reminder dials
- 3x 1/4-20 mounting points for expandability

### What you'll need:
- 1x 1/4-20 x 3/8" hex drive pan head screw
- 2x 1/4-20 x 1/2" hex drive pan head screw
- 3x 1/4-20 x 7mm Heatset Threaded Insert
- 6x M1.6 x 5mm self tapping or machine screws
- 10x M4 x 12mm Hex Cap Machine Screw
- 10x M4 x 8mm Heatset Threaded Insert
- 1x Soldering Iron or Heat Set Insert Jig
- Assortment of mini files

### What would be helpful:
- M4 drill bit
- M5.3 drill bit
- 1/4 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS

Normally, I would recommend PETG but it's pretty bad with impacts.

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M4 heatset inserts require M5.3 bore.
- 1/4-20 heatset inserts require a 8.8ish mm bore.

Use the attached Affinity Designer .afdesign file to edit and print your film reminder dial labels. Affinity Designer is now free to use so sign up and grab it!

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, download FreeCAD to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble. If using FreeCAD, the naming conventions should carry over and you will be able to see which lens element you need from the various smartphone lenses. (Verified in FreeCAD 0.18) If using something like Solid Edge open the file as an assembly to retain the names of the parts.
