### Features:
- Arca-Swiss compatible rail.
- Customizable & Removeable 90 degree Arca-Swiss rail.
- Common dilm reminder dials
- 3x 1/4-20 mounting points for expandability

### What you'll need:
- 1x 1/4-20 x 3/8" hex drive pan head screw
- 2x 1/4-20 x 1/2" hex drive pan head screw
- 3x 1/4-20 x 7mm Heatset Threaded Insert
- 6x M1.6 x 5mm self tapping or machine screws
- 10x M4 x 12mm Hex Cap Machine Screw
- 10x M4 x 8mm Heatset Threaded Insert
- 1x Soldering Iron or Heat Set Insert Jig
- Assortment of mini files

### What would be helpful:
- M4 drill bit
- M5.3 drill bit
- 1/4 drill bit

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS

Normally, I would recommend PETG but it's pretty bad with impacts.

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M4 heatset inserts require M5.3 bore.
- 1/4-20 heatset inserts require a 8.8ish mm bore.

You will need to file the Sliding Arm so it slides smoothly in the Base Bracket. Additionally, you will need to file the dove tail on the Side Bracket for a snug fit in the Sliding Arm.

You may need to clean up the M2 hole after heat setting the threaded insert.
